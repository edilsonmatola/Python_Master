# Booleans
# Booleans represent one of two possible values: True or False. Let's take an example.

result1 = True
result2 = False

print(result1)  # Output: True
print(result2)  # Output: False

"""
* There are a few things we need to understand about booleans:

* True is a boolean. However, if we use True inside quotation marks, 'True', it is a string. It's the same case * for False and 'False'.
* True and False are not variables. In fact, we cannot create variables named True and False.
* True and False must start with a capital letter.
